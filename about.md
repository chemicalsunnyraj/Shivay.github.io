<p>
I am Di. I enjoy research and always try this and that out and see whether something magic can be created to the world. I like NLP, especially on transfer learning, question answering, adversarial robustness, and conversational AI. I am happy to connect and discuss anything interesting about research, about NLP, or about future technologies!
